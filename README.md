Game: Playroom

  In this game, you are a child who didn't clean your room. To teach you a lesson, your parents shrunk you down  to the size of an ant to let you experience how dirty your room was. During your journey to the door, you encounter many gargantuan beasts that were once tiny compared to you, now posing a real threat to you. As you continue on your adventure, collect weapons and items from slaying enemies and shops to defeat stronger and stronger foes, up until the final boss...
